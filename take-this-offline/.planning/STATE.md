## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- UI-first sequencing: build full frontend with seed data before activating AI pipeline
- Fully automated AI pipeline in v1, no admin review UI
- Vector embeddings (pgvector) for semantic deduplication, not string matching
- User timezone stored at subscription time for local-time push delivery
- Dynamic OG images via `next/og` (bundled in App Router, no separate install)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Vercel Pro plan required for hourly cron (push dispatch). Hobby plan allows only one cron/day. Confirm tier before Phase 4.
- iOS web push only works for installed PWAs (iOS 16.4+). Email digest is the primary iOS notification channel.
